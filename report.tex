TODO: Describe params...

\subsection{Decision variables}

For the problem, 3 matrices are needed as decision variables. The last one is
auxiliary.
%
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c l}
\toprule
Symbol & Type and size \\
\midrule
$P$ & Binary matrix of size $N \times H$.\\
$W$ & Binary matrix of size $N \times H$.\\
$T$ & Binary matrix of size $N \times H$.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
The matrix $P$ has the element $P_{n,h} = 1$ if the nurse $n$ is at the hospital
at hour $n$, also if is working, $W_{n,h} = 1$, otherwise 0.
%
The matrix $T$ is an auxiliary matrix, with the element $T_{n,h} = 1$ if the
nurse $n$ is travelling to the hospital at the hour $h$, otherwise 0.

\subsection{Constraints}

\paragraph{Constraint 1} At least $\textrm{demand}_h$ nurses should be working
at the hour $h$.
$$ \forall h\in H,\, \sum_{n \in N} W_{n,h} \ge \textrm{demand}_h$$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 2} Each working nurse should work at least minHours.
$$ \forall n \in N,\, \sum_{h \in H} W_{n,h} \ge
	\textrm{minHours} * \sum_{j \in H} T_{n,j} $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 3} Each nurse should work at most maxHours.
$$ \forall n \in N,\, \sum_{h \in H} W_{n,h} \le \textrm{maxHours} $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 4a} Each nurse should work at most maxConsec consecutive
hours.
$$ \forall n \in N,\, \forall h \in [1, \textrm{nHours} - \textrm{maxConsec}],$$
$$\sum_{k \in [0, maxConsec]} W_{n, h+k} \le \textrm{maxConsec}
$$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 4b} Wrap around case for maxConsecutive hours.
$$ \forall n \in N,\, \forall h \in [1, \textrm{maxConsec}],$$
$$\sum_{j \in [1, h]} W_{n, j} +
	\sum_{j \in [nHours-maxConsec+h, nHours]} W_{n, j}  \le \textrm{maxConsec}
$$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 5} No nurse can stay at the hospital for more than
maxPresence hours.
$$ \forall n \in N, \, \sum_{h \in H} P_{n,h} \le \textrm{maxPresence} $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 6} No nurse can rest for more than one consecutive hour.
$$ \forall n \in N,\, \forall h \in [1, \textrm{nHours-1}],$$
$$W_{n, h} + W_{n, h+1} \ge P_{n,h+1} $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 7} Working nurses can travel to hospital at most once.
$$ \forall n \in N,\,$$
$$ \sum_{h \in H} T_{n,h} \le 1 $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 8a} If a nurse is present at current hour and wasn't at 
previous hour, then they traveled to hospital at current hour.
$$ \forall n N, \,\forall h \in [2, \textrm{nHours}],\,$$
$$ T_{n,h} \ge 1 - P_{n, h-1} + P_{n, h} - 1 $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 8b} Add case for wrap-around
$$ \forall n \in N,\,$$
$$ T_{n, 1} \ge 1 - P_{n, nHours} + P_{n, 1} - 1 $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 9} If nurse travels at current hour, then they were not 
present at previous hour.
$$ \forall n \in N,\,\forall h \in [2, \textrm{nHours}],\,$$
$$ T_{n,h} \le 1 - P_{n, h-1} $$
%
\paragraph{Constraint 10} If nurse travels at current hour, then they are 
present at current hour.
$$ \forall n \in N,\,\forall h \in H,\,$$
$$ T_{n,h} \le P_{n, h} $$

\section{GRASP}
%
The GRASP method is a metaheuristic in which each iteration consists of two 
phases: construction and local search.

First, we need to specify the problem in terms of part that can be selected. The 
ground set $E$ contains elements that can be selected in order to build a 
solution. Let $S$ be a posible solution by selecting parts of $E$, so $S \in 
2^E$. We can build $F$ as the set of solutions that are feasible $F \subseteq 
2^E$

In our problem, we need to select the behavior of $N$ nurses. A posible solution 
can be defined by the selection of elements that describe what a nurse $n$ is 
doing at the time $h$. A tuple $t = (n, h, s)$ can code that the nurse $n$ 
should be at state $s$ in the time $h$. A feasible solution $S$ should consist 
of a selection of tuples $t$ such that, they define the behavior of every nurse 
at every time, and also be consistent with the previous constraints.

Furthermore, in order to build a solution, a notion of cost is needed to select 
among all the posible tuples that can be selected. Lets ignore the constraints 
in the cost function, and check the feasibility at the end. Iteratively we can 
select a naive solution by a simple procedure. We begin with an empty solution, 
at time $h = 1$. At that time, we have a demand $d$ given by 
$\textrm{demand}_h$. A good candidate will be try to meet the demand by adding 
working nurses, the RCL will have the tuples with working nurses in such a way 
that they are selected with high probability. Then, one of the posible 
combination will be chosen, hopefully assigning one nurse to work in that time.  
Then we continue adding nurses in a working state. Once the demand is met, then 
we now will prefer adding to the solution tuples that contain nurses in a 
non-working status. The probability of such state should now be added with high 
probability.

The selection of the cost function is the core of the GRASP algorithm, so we 
need to take some care to guarantee a good behavior.
